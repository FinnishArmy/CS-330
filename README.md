## How do I approach designing software?
### What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
I have learned many ways to design lighting, texturing, object design using basic objects with an efficient use of triangles.

### What design process did you follow for your project work?
I ensured that I followed coding best practices by making sure that my code was modular so that if it needs to be edited in the future
is it easy to make changes or make additions.

### How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Using the skills I learned here, I can now begin learning Advanced OpenGL lighting. I would like to create my own Minecraft
Shaders to change how lighting works in the video game as a "mod."

## How do I approach developing programs?
### What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
The entire design process for OpenGL was new to me. I will use the best design practices of modular code because not using modular code
makes it very difficult to design a 3D scene. If you are repeatidly copy pasting sections of code to create a new object, if you need
to make changes to the scene, it will take much longer to do.

### How did iteration factor into your development?
Itreating triangles to manipulate them into the 3D shape that I want is what made the entire scene how I wanted it.

### How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
Approaching the final project by implementing each part into the milestones made the final much easier to implement. Rather than 
trying to implement everything at once, dividing them into seperate sections was clean and easy to approach.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Seeing something that was as daunting as creating a 3D scene in C++ actually work with the tools and knowledge I have now gives me the 
passion to approach things that seem difficult. I previously thought that this would be extremely difficult, but approaching it in
sections made it easy.
